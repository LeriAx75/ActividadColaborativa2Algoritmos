"""
1. read an input file containing the information of a graph represented in the form of an adjacency matrix with weighted graphs. 
The weight of each edge is the distance in kilometers from neighborhood to neighborhood, where it is feasible to put wiring.
The program must display which is the optimal way to wire with optical fiber connecting neighborhoods in such a way that information can be shared between any two neighborhoods [hint: Dijkstra's algorithm].
